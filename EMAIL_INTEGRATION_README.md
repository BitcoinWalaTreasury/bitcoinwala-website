# Email Integration - BitcoinWala Contact Form

## What's Been Implemented

✅ **EmailJS Integration**: Your contact form now sends emails directly to `mdrizvanali01@gmail.com`
✅ **Form Validation**: All fields are required and validated
✅ **Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly error messages if email fails
✅ **Loading States**: Shows spinner while sending email
✅ **Success Confirmation**: Shows thank you message after successful submission
✅ **Controlled Components**: Form data is properly managed and resets after submission

## Files Modified

1. **ContactModal.tsx** - Updated with EmailJS integration
2. **package.json** - Added @emailjs/browser dependency
3. **.env** - Created with EmailJS configuration placeholders
4. **App.tsx** - Added email test utility import

## Files Created

1. **EMAILJS_SETUP.md** - Complete setup guide
2. **src/utils/emailTest.ts** - Test utility for debugging
3. **EMAIL_INTEGRATION_README.md** - This file

## Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Set Up EmailJS Account
Follow the detailed guide in `EMAILJS_SETUP.md` to:
- Create EmailJS account
- Connect your Gmail
- Create email template
- Get your credentials

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Replace the placeholders in `.env` with your actual EmailJS credentials:
```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_actual_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_actual_template_id  
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key
```

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console and run: `testEmailJS()`
3. Or test through the actual contact form

## How It Works

1. **User fills form** → Form data is collected
2. **User submits** → EmailJS sends email with form data
3. **Email arrives** → You receive formatted email at mdrizvanali01@gmail.com
4. **User sees confirmation** → Success message displayed
